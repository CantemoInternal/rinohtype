RinohType
=========

RinohType is a document preparation system in the style of LaTeX_. It still has
a ways to go before a first release can be made, but it already implements a lot
of functionality.

For a detailed introduction to RinohType and a report of its current status, see
this `blog article`_. If you want to try running RinohType, please refer to the
rest of this README.

Requirements
------------

RinohType was originally developed as a Python 3-only project. However, recently
it was ported to also run on Python 2 for testing with PyPy_. I recommend
running the Python 3 version for now, as there are probably still some problems
with the Python 2 port. That said, you can find the Python 2-compatible code in
the *python2* and *pypy2* branches.

The core of RinohType does not depend on any other Python packages. If you want
to use reStructuredText_ as an input format, you will need the docutils_
package. For citations and bibliography rendering, you will need citeproc-py_.

Running the examples
--------------------

I should warn you that some PDF readers have trouble displaying the PDFs
generated by RinohType (`issue 2`_). It seems like this is a bug in these PDF readers, but
this still needs to be verified.

The repository includes two examples. First, you need to clone the RinohType
repository. Make sure you also check out the submodule::

    git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/brechtm/rinohtype.git

The first example demonstrates most of RinohType's features. It parses text from
an XML file and renders it as a two-column article. A shell script is included
to set up ``PYTHONPATH`` (since it is not yet possible to install RinohType
easily)::

    cd rinohtype/examples/rfic2009
    ./template.sh

When the script finishes, you will find ``template.pdf`` in the current
directory.

The second example requires the docutils_ package. It parses a the
reStructuredText quickstart_ document and renders it to ``quickstart.pdf``::

    cd rinohtype/examples/restructuredtext
    ./test.sh

Please bear in mind that these examples have not yet been polished. At the
moment, they merely serve to assist development rather than look good. Once the
codebase is more mature, proper stylesheets will be created to deliver pretty
output.
