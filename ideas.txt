to do:
* master pages
* headings
* lists (numbered, unnumbered, labels, ...)
* floats
* figures (external)
* tables
* in-line text formatting
* headers and footers

later:
* hyphenation (http://code.google.com/p/python-hyphenator/)
* unicode
* right-to-left
** use LASi for supporting many languages (or just Pango?)
* text flow around non-rectangular object

==============================================================================

problems with tex:
* fonts and encoding (see PyPSG below)
* simple layouting is not possible easily
* TeX code is difficult to write/read

ideas:
* OO design
* keep it simple, also at the lowest level, if possible
* actual typesetting in C or C++ (pslib now)
* provide constructions for:
    * emphasis, bold, ...
    * floats
    * tables
    * figures
    * equations (using TeX via PyX initially)
* Container can contain text:
    * associate:
        * paragraph style
            * font style
            * indenting
            * justification
* user should be able to set variables (input is python file?)

* http://freshmeat.net/projects/fonttools/
* use PSlib:
    * can do kerning & ligatures
    * can do hypenation
    * will still have problems with font encoding!

    * "The text functons support Type1 fonts and dynamically
        re-encodes them based on unicode(!) input"
