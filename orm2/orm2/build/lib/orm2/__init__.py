Welcome to The Object Relational Membrane (v.2)
===============================================

 I{For a general introduction please refer to the U{README<http://cvs.savannah.nongnu.org/viewcvs/*checkout*/orm2/README?root=orm>} file in the
 distribution root folder!}

 To get started with orm you might want to look at the
 L{orm2.datatypes} module first to find out what datatypes are there
 to populate your dbclasses with. Knowing a little SQL this should be
 pretty much self-explaining. Next, check out the
 L{orm2.relationships} module to see how you can interrelate your
 classes. The L{orm2.dbobject.dbobject} class has a couple of
 interesting properties, though you might not want to fiddle with most
 of it at the beginning. The L{orm2.adapters} module contains code for
 interfacing with the RDBMS, though the L{orm2.datasource.datasource}
 may likely be everything you need.

 To further study the intricacies of orm you might want to have a look
 at the L{orm2.sql} module, which handles SQL code generation and is
 going to be very helpful in writing advanced code. Consider using and/or
 interfacing with L{orm2.debug} to help you track down my and your
 errors. L{orm2.util} contains miscellaneous classes and functions
 that might come in handy.

 The L{orm2.ui} module is practically not there, yet, but you might be
 interested anyway.

 Any ideas, suggestion or criticism is always welcome!
