Please provide the following information to make your bug report as useful as
possible.

1. The **messages** output by rinohtype (and Sphinx) when rendering the
   document.
2. A link to the **source files** (e.g. Sphinx project). Without this, it would
   take too much time to reproduce the bug. If you cannot share the source
   files publicly, try to create dummy input files that reproduce the bug (may
   be difficult). Alternatively, you can send the input files to us privately.
   Look for an email address in the main
   [readme](https://github.com/brechtm/rinohtype#rinohtype).

Please also provide the following information:
* rinohtype version: (output from `rinoh --version`)
* Sphinx version: (output from `sphinx-build --version`)
* Python version: (output from `python --version`)
* operating system: (Windows, Linux, MacOS)
