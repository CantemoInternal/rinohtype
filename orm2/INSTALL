                     Building and Installing ORM
                     ---------------------------

* Installing

ORM comes with batteries included... er... a distutils style setup.py.

To use it just go to the orm2/orm2 directory and type

  python2.3 setup.py build

and then

  python2.3 setup.py install

for the last step you'll probably need root privileges. If you don't
have root privileges use the --prefix parameter to pass a suitable directory
in your PYTHONPATH to setup.py

That's it! You should be ready to go!
