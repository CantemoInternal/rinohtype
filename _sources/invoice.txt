Tutorial: Invoice
=================

This section walks you through the creation of a custom document. The example
used is an invoice. This is a fairly simple document for which we'll define
a document template and a custom style sheet.


.. testcode::
    from rinoh.document import DocumentSection, DocumentPart
    from rinohlib.template.base import DocumentTemplate

    class InvoicePart(DocumentPart):
        def first_page(self):
            raise NotImplementedError

        def new_page(self, chains):
            """Called by :meth:`render` with the :class:`Chain`s that need more
            :class:`Container`s. This method should create a new :class:`Page` which
            contains a container associated with `chain`."""
            raise NotImplementedError


    class InvoiceSection(DocumentSection):
        parts = [ArticlePart]

    class Invoice(DocumentTemplate):
        sections = []
        options_class = DocumentOptions
